HttpClientExtras
================

This is a set of handlers to provide different signatures for the HttpClient requests:

- OAuthProtectedResourceMessageHandler (OAuth1)
- OAuthClientAuthMessageHandler (2-legged OAuth1)
- AzureTableMessageHandler


The main library is portable, there are platform-specific adapters to use encryption services.
